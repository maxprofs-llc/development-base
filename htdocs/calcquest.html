We use the referring page information to make sure you are coming from an authorized site and are not a bandwidth stealer or hacker. Many sites use the referring information for similar purposes.  You can check the support area for your particular security product for specific information on how to allow passing of that information to our site.</li></ul></li>
    <LI><span class=calc_title>My BMI is 28, I work out all the time and your program says I am overweight, that is wrong.</span><ul><li>It depends on your perspective, BMI is a measure of body mass, how much "stuff" you body has to pump blood through, if your BMI is over 25, that is more than your cardiovascular system was designed for.  Your BMI and the guidelines of this site are recommendations, check with your physician for your specific situation.</li></ul></li>
    <LI><span class=calc_title>Your calculator won't provide me results when I enter my age.</span><ul><li>The government has put out restrictions on information that can be collected by Internet sites from minors.  If you are below that cutoff point, we won't process your information.  Sorry, wish we could.</li></ul></li>
