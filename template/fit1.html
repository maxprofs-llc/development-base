                  <p>This fitness assessment will consist of four individual parts, the step test, sit-up test, push-up test and trunk flexibility.  Additionally, we will need several body measurements.  You should print this instruction page out on your printer.  There is a place for you to record your results for each component.  You will need the following: a yard stick, a tape measure, something to write with, a stopwatch, timer, or watch with a second hand, and a strip of masking tape.  The order you do the parts is not important, nor is it important to do them immediately after each other.  Do one part, record the results, take a break, or even wait until the next day to do the next.  It is recommended that you do some general stretching and warm-up exercises prior to doing each component.  Remember to keep breathing and drink lots of water.  You will enter the results and other information into the results page.  We will then calculate your fitness and produce a personalized report for you.</p>
